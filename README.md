# CIPHERBYTE TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT ON C PROGRAMMING
## Created by- **Swastik Bhattacharya**
Hi there, I am *Swastik Bhattacharya*, seeking to be an ambitious programmer.
I have created this project for my internship task given by CipherByte Technologies using the knowledge of C Programming. I am really thankful to them for giving me this wonderful opportunity.
## TASKS:
### TASK- 1: STUDENT GRADE MANAGEMENT
The provided C program is designed to manage student grades within an educational context. It offers functionalities for inputting student information, including names and scores in multiple subjects, calculating average scores, identifying the highest and lowest scores, and presenting a summary of students' performance.

1. *Input Student Information*: The program prompts the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects for each student. It then collects data such as student names and their corresponding scores for each subject.

2. *Average Score Calculation*: Using the input data, the program calculates the average score for each student by summing up their scores in all subjects and dividing by the total number of subjects.

3. *Identifying Highest and Lowest Scores*: It identifies the highest and lowest scores among all students and subjects, keeping track of which student achieved each extreme score.

4. *Performance Summary*: Finally, the program generates a performance summary that includes details such as the highest and lowest scores achieved, along with the corresponding student names. Additionally, it displays individual student scores and their average scores across subjects.

This program utilizes arrays and structures to store student data efficiently, loops to iterate through students and subjects, and mathematical calculations to derive average scores and identify extreme scores. It provides educators with a tool to manage and analyze student performance effectively.
### TASK- 2: BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
The provided C program is a simulation of a bank account management system. It allows users, such as bank customers or administrators, to perform various operations related to bank accounts.

1. *Account Creation*: Users can create new bank accounts by specifying an account number, account type (Savings or Current), and initial balance. The program stores this information in an array of BankAccount structures.

2. *Deposit and Withdrawal*: Users can deposit funds into an existing account by providing the account number and the amount to deposit. Likewise, they can withdraw funds by specifying the account number and the amount to withdraw. The program checks for sufficient balance before processing withdrawals.

3. *Check Balance*: Users can check the current balance of any account by entering the account number. The program retrieves and displays the balance for the corresponding account.

4. *Interest Calculation*: For Savings accounts, the program calculates and adds interest based on a predefined interest rate (5% in this case). It identifies Savings accounts and calculates interest on their balances, updating the balances accordingly.

The program utilizes structures (struct) to represent bank accounts, functions to perform specific operations like deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation, and a menu-driven interface that allows users to choose from different options to manage bank accounts effectively.
### TASK- 3: EXPENSE TRACKER
The provided C program is an Expense Tracker application designed to help users manage their daily expenditures effectively. It offers a user-friendly interface with options to record expenses under different categories, generate visual reports, and gain insights into spending patterns.

1. *Recording Expenses*: Users can input their expenses by specifying the expense category (e.g., groceries, transportation) and the amount spent. The program stores this information in an array of Expense structures.

2. *Generating Reports*: The application allows users to generate expense reports that provide a summary of their spending. The report includes a breakdown of expenses by category and calculates the total amount spent in each category as well as the overall total expenditure.

3. *Insights into Spending Patterns*: By visualizing expenses in a report format, users can gain insights into their spending patterns, identify areas where they are spending more, and make informed decisions to manage their finances better.

4. *User-Friendly Interface*: The program employs a menu-driven interface that guides users through different options, making it easy for them to record expenses and generate reports effortlessly.

Overall, this Expense Tracker application serves as a handy tool for individuals to track their expenses, analyze their spending habits, and take proactive steps towards financial management and budgeting.
